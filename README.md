# Yarin’s Small Projects

This organization gathers small projects, exercises, and experiments I’ve built while learning, practicing, or exploring new ideas. Most of the work here is in Python, with a focus on practical scripts, backend logic, and general problem-solving.

Each repository stands on its own. Some were built as part of courses, some for personal use, and some just for fun. Together they show my range of interests and how I approach real code, not just polished final projects.
